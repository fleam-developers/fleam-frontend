In this way, people started to do the work easier than in old times that used to be difficult and demanding to do. Thus, various sectors have adapted to these developments in technology. One of these sectors is the movie industry. In the past, people went to the movie theater to watch a movie. Now, they can easily access the movie they want, whenever they want, wherever they want, from a mobile phone, computer, or smart TV. In this process, many platforms have emerged that provide such services. Especially with the start of the pandemic process, people started to spend longer at home. Eventually, the interest in these platforms has increased.",

      text: "On the Frontend side, React, a very popular JavaScript library, was preferred. React is used by many giant companies such as Facebook and Netflix. It is also compatible with different libraries and frameworks such as React, Redux, which is a current and widely used technology. Our previous experience is also a factor in our preference for this library. While a modern technology such as React was preferred, a modern method was also preferred for state management. Due to the size and complexity of the project, if the state management were tried to be provided directly through React, it would have caused problems for the project. That's why Redux, a JavaScript library used to manage and centralize application state, was chosen. Redux Toolkit was used to develop Redux more efficiently and easily. In this way, our efficiency in the development process increased and we were able to write code more easily and effectively. \n \n\n Redux Architecture has a central store. It sends actions by connecting to reducers through pure functions. Then the reducer updates the centralized store with new data according to the action type it takes. The store creates a new status and sends an update to view. Immediately afterwards, the view was rebuilt to reflect the update. \n Redux Toolkit is a library that compiles Redux and its plugins and brings together best practices. It simplifies the complexity of Redux. Configuring the Store with the configureStore function in Redux Toolkit is quite simple compared to createStore in Redux. Logical expressions can be created and shared with the createSlice function. In addition, actions can be easily managed with createAsyncThunk. Using this structure made state management in the project easier. \n The Axios library was used to send requests that will establish a connection with the backend side and send and receive data. Using this library has been very useful and convenient. Since the backend and frontend sides were developed separately, it was necessary to test whether the requests were going correctly before the connection was established and to continue the development process accordingly. A json-server setup is provided to control these requests on the frontend. The json-server provided a fake Rest API and the tests were temporarily run through this Rest API.",

      text: "In todayâ€™s world there are two main backend architectures for web applications. One of them is the traditional way, which is the monolithic architecture and the other is the one that became popular in the last 10 years which is microservice architecture. Main idea of the microservice design pattern is building easy to develop and deploy, independent and flexible software systems. On the other hand some worldwide streaming companies, like Netflix and Spotify, build their products using microservice architecture to serve their customers. Even though using microservices brings its own cons like, managing and maintaining multiple services, handling failures during communication of services, network latency and load balancing; it brings lots of advantages like scalability, preventing single point of failure, easy deployment, efficient resource management, separation of business logic etc. Especially in a video streaming platform, there are different requirements which have different costs and needs. For example, for user specific requirements like authorization/authentication making comments, rating movies, are not time consuming tasks. But like video streaming or inferencing a machine learning model for movie recommendations are time and resource consuming tasks. So separating those tasks into microservices and populating them based on the traffic then making load balance between the instances is a good idea to manage a video streaming platform. In that sense it is decided to develop such a system with microservice architecture.",
